# MouseOverSounds_PvP
MouseOverSounds_PvP plays a warning sound whenever you mouseover an unit that is:
- PvP enabled and enemy player
- PvP enabled and friendly player
- PvP enabled and enemy NPC

This addon is based on the following addon: https://github.com/Lexiebean/MouseOverSounds

There is no in-built customization whatsoever. The sound can be changed by replacing the ogg sound file.

I've created this addon mainly after being annoyed with automatically and absent-mindedly buffing friendly players which are PvP flagged - PvP-flagging myself in the process.

As usual, be sure to remove -master suffix from the folder name so that the addon install location is: `..\Interface\AddOns\MouseOverSounds_PvP`
